![pexels-alexander-nadrilyanski-3684122](https://github.com/PraveenLiyanage/Object_Detection_YOLO/assets/111709030/644d3b36-0a62-4698-9d9b-6c5f63e3a73b)

## Overview

This project implements Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection system. YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It's known for its speed and accuracy.

## Features

- YOLOv8 implementation for object detection.
- Pre-trained weights for quick setup and testing.
- Supports multiple object classes.
- Easy-to-use and well-documented code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveenliyanage/Object_Detection_YOLO.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

- cd Object_Detection_YOLO

## Download YOLOv8 :
